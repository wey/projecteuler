module Problems021to030 where




-- Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
-- If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a != b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
-- For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. 
-- The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
-- Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

-- Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
-- begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, 
-- multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
-- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, 
-- is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.
-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

-- A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. 
-- For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
-- A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
-- As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. 
-- By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. 
-- However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed 
-- as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
-- Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

-- A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
-- If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
--     012   021   102   120   201   210
-- What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
